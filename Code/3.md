Standard homography-based method can fail with poor perspective (e.g. when the vanishing point is close to the $\infty$) $\rightarrow$ use iterative method.

**$1 \degree$ estimate**: vanishing point $V_X = line(A'B') \cap line(C'D') \rightarrow$ direction of $AB = K^{-1} V_X$.

From length $\bar{AB}$, direction of $AB$ and images $A',B'$ $\rightarrow$ 3D position of $AB$, same for $CD$ $\rightarrow$ position estimation of back plane $\rightarrow$ from $\phi$, find vertical direction w.r.t. camera.

Please consider the following:
- $A$: is the internal point of the left rear light of the car
- $B$: is the internal point of the right rear light of the car
- $C$: is the top left corner of the target place
- $D$: is the top right corner of the target place
- $E$: is the external point of the left rear light of the car
- $F$: is the external point of the right rear light of the car

Rotation angle $\theta$ of the model $E,A,B,F$ within the horizontal plane (rotation about the vertical axis): angle between x axis of the camera and direction of $AB$ (or $CD$ or $EF$).

**slide3**
Rotation angle $\theta$ btw x-axis of camera and direction of AB (or CD or EF).
Instead of considering true points E, A, B, F we use vertically translated points, such that their z coords = to z coord of camera center O, and the images of these translated points* $\rightarrow$ all points are on a horizontal plane through O $\rightarrow$ Problem becomes 2D $\rightarrow$ 1D projection: one unknown $\theta$.                        
Use geometry to find angle $\theta$.

**slide4**
To find image of vertically translated points
- use estimated vertical vanishing point $V_Z$
- derive estimated horizontal vanishing line $l'_\infty$
- use new image points, e.g. $A'' = l'_\infty \cap line(V_Z, A')$

# Iterative refinement of pose estimate

- From current estimate of vertical rotation angle $\theta$  
- Update estimated direction of segment AB (and CD)  
- From new direction estimates, localize AB and CD in 3D, and update estimate of the back plane (plane through A, B, C, D) and, from known angle $\phi$, update both bottom vertical bounding plane and horizontal ground plane (relative to camera)  
- Use calibration matrix to update estimates of vertical vanishing point $V_Z$ and horizontal vanishing line $l'_\infty$  
- Use updated $V_Z$ and $l'_\infty$ to generate updated estimate of angle $\theta$.
